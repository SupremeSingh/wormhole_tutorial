Part 1 - Sending a msg from src chain to the Wormhole Network 

Prereq - Understanding Woemhole basics, Call vs Delegate Call 

Here, we have a function, sendStr() that takes in a bytes array and a nonce (random number) that 
will call the Wormhole SDK and submit the message. In the publishMessage() function, the arguments are ...

- Nonce: A random number. Needed so same msg is not validated twice
- Bytes: An array of bytes that can hold any data
- Finality: How many blocks to wait on the source chain to consider it safe that the message wonâ€™t roll back. 

This works by - 

- First, we convert our string to a bytes array to save memory (and hence gas costs) on the EVM
- The contract we have deployed then makes a function CALL to the core bridge contract on Ropsten 
- The core contract takes the message and packages it into a VAA after 1 block has elapsed 
- The core contract then makes a DELEGATE CALL (maintaining it's context) to another contract
